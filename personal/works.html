I would like to improve the game by adding a textbox in which people can type in the name and the computer will check if their guess was right or not. this game mostly consists of HTML and python.

If you touch the wall you die, and you also don't have to collect all of the coins to get to the middle. the ghosts will just randomly spawn out of nowhere so you must be cautious.
